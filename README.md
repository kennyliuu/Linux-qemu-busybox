# 🐧 Linux-qemu-busybox
In order to realize and learn the Linux kernel, it's a little side project about building and simulating a minimal Linux(for ARM64 with BusyBox and QEMU), include kernel module and debugfs.

## 📁 Abstract

This project builds a minimal Linux environment using:
- QEMU for ARM64 simulation
- BusyBox as rootfs
- Custom kernel module (hello.ko)
